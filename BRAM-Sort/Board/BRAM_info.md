### Note:  

* This implementation depends upon the Block Memory Generator Intellectual Property Core available in the Vivado Design Suite.  
* An IP Core for a True Dual-Port BRAM has been integrated as a component in this implementation.  
* A similar core would need to be generated and interfaced in order for the implementation to work.
